# Task 01

## Overview

- I have a schematics in koder/tmp/schematics.jpeg
- I need to convert this into an step by step, animated visualisation
- it should extremely good
- it should follow the aesthetics of ~/Projects/Onesource/lens/frontend_02/
- it should use the skill: "fazt-app" to build it
- build each component in the animation separately and build it intricately

## Important

- Understand this is a fazt-app and will be deployed to fazt (the project
  recently got renamed to holm)
- fazt project is available in ~/Projects/fazt-holm/ to review
- the concepts of fazt is available in knowledge-base/
- Specifically for this, focus on desktop experience & you can ignore mobile
  responsiveness if needed

## References

- The system is trying to map out the pipeline here:
  ~/Projects/Onesource/lens/pipeline/funds/04_pif/ (an example)
- you can review Lens project ~/Projects/Onesource/lens/ to understand how the
  pipeline works

## Purpose

- this will be used in a presentation to visualise the flow

## Goal

- we need to showcase this as a sophosticated AI agentic pipeline that will work
  automatically
- Think about this rough narrative: we collect all sorts of docs of a fund, load
  it into the system, it automatically goes & understand it; and do "query
  expansion"; for each query an agentic system will do deep research to find
  matching companies in that sector. Then each startup will be granularly
  extracted in a list with key details; post that another deep research agent
  will go through each startup to find details about each of them, finally we
  combine all of them with our taxonomy and produce analysable/structured data
  of highest quality; the next stage will to be to store this in a vectorDB for
  sematic search
- Understand beyond pinning on the reality of the true stages of the actual
  pipeline; use it as a guide but lean heavily of the above narrative to build
  the visualisation

## Note

- implement the system to attempts/xx/
- if there are multiple ones, specifially ask if the user wants to work on a
  specific or start a new attempt
